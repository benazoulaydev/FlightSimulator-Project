# FlightSimulator-Project
A readme with all the flight simulators mini project we did.

## Part 1: Flight-Simulator-Cpp
Flight Simulator is a cpp program that control a plane From FlightGear Game.

## Part 2: GENERIC SOLVER C++
The purpose of the code is to open a connection with clients using socket, with serial server or parallel server (multi-thread) clients can send problem to the server. And the server solve their problems using algorithms.

## Part 3: FlightSimulatorApp WPF
This project is a desktop application programmed in WPF for controlling a Flight Simulator ("FlightGear"). The program recieves C&C signals and its design is inspired by the MVVM architecture. You can control the simulator by moving a joystick, Throttle, Aileron, changing or by sending commands to the simulator. This project written in c# with client-server implementation.

## Part 4: flightSimulatorWebApi
In this Project we will build an airplane control system, which is required to monitor active flights and allows to enter News Flight. The flight plan describes the take-off time of the aircraft from a particular point on Earth as well Consists of a list of waypoints where the plane passes and the estimated time it reaches each point. During the exercise Assume the flights are running as planned and the air traffic control system advertises its location at any given time according to plan Fed to him. The built airplane control system will be synchronized with other air control systems so that users can also track the status of flights entered into their system and other flights entered into Exterior control systems.

## Part 5: FlightMobileApp Android
In this Project we will build an Android app that will control an airplane via the Flight Simulator. 
Our application will communicate via an HTTP protocol to an intermediary server, which will send our requests to the simulator. 
The broker server will connect to only one simulator, so it will only be able to serve one client. 
Its purpose is to enable standard communication between the client application and the server through known Web protocols. 
The Android app will be written in Kotlin language, and the intermediary server will be implemented in #C using ASP.NET Core technology.
